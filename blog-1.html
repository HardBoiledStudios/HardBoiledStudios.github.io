              <p>
                &emsp;Hi, this is Colleen from HardBoiled Studios! HardBoiled
                Studios is a student-run video game development studio, and we
                have been working on our debut game Yolked since Winter of 2020.
                And eep, the secret is OUT!
                <b
                  >We‚Äôre releasing our game on Steam for early access in October
                  2021.
                </b>
                It‚Äôs been a long but rewarding journey, and we‚Äôre so excited to
                have you all play it! <br /><br />
                &emsp;You may not know much about us yet, but not for long! If
                you‚Äôre interested, keep up with us through our DevBlogs. Today,
                I‚Äôll be sharing the story of how <i>Yolked</i> was born. *Cue
                the harps* <br /><br />
                &emsp;Our core team consists of our video game developers: Baha
                Okten, Floney Yang, and Hazel Wong. Baha, Floney, and Hazel
                alumni of the University of Michigan, Computer Science majors,
                and video game lovers. In January 2020, the trio met each other
                in a class called ‚ÄúIntroduction to Video Game Development‚Äù. It
                was an elective that had interested each of them because of
                their affinity towards video games: Baha modded and owned
                several Minecraft servers growing up, Hazel has always been a
                casual gamer, and Floney was fascinated with games that had
                beautiful designs.
                <br /><br />
                &emsp;For the final project, Baha, Floney, Hazel, and two other
                classmates formed a team to create a demo version of Yolked for
                the Virtual Games Showcase at the end of the semester. Hazel
                came up with the idea of an egg escaping a kitchen, and they all
                wanted to create a fun, humorous game that had difficult but
                addicting mechanics. Yolked originally started as a co-op game;
                however, the team decided to make Yolked a single player game
                since their showcase would be in a remote setting (thanks,
                COVID). And then... Yolked won first place in the showcase!
              </p>

              <p>
                <i
                  >Baha reminisced about the project saying that their group
                  ‚Äúwas probably one of the best teams that we could have. It was
                  really balanced, and we were all lucky to be on the same team.
                  We synergize really well. We all have really important tasks
                  that couldn‚Äôt have been done with one of us missing‚Ä¶ And we
                  became really good friends.‚Äù

                ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Author‚Äôs note: Aw, all this sweetness might give me a cavity
                ü¶∑ü•∞
              </p>
              <hr />

              <p class="text-center">
                &emsp;<i>Yolked</i>‚Äôs initial success during the student
                showcase compelled the trio to continue working on completing
                the game. To help with the art and assets for the game, Eli
                Lustig (also a University of Michigan student) joined the team
                as a 3D Artist in August 2020. <br /><br />
                &emsp;The small, four-person team at the time realized during
                the summer of 2020 that they wanted to see how the project might
                fit into the ‚Äúreal‚Äù gaming world. They wanted to learn more
                about the gaming industry and put their all into it! They
                started submitting applications and emailing pitch decks to
                indie game publishers and caught the attention of several
                publishing studios during this process. In the end, they decided
                to partner with Hitcents due to their extensive experience with
                marketing and the fact that they had a similar vision for our
                game. I (Colleen Tacubao) joined in June 2021 to work on
                marketing for the team.
                <br /><br />
                &emsp;The transition from class project to soon-to-be-published
                indie video game was a gradual one. Still, we all have the same
                vision to take this as seriously as we can to get experience
                and, most importantly, to create a good game for people to
                enjoy.
                <br /><br />
                ---
                <br /><br />
                Stay tuned! Yolked will be published on Steam and Nintendo
                Switch in 2022. Early access on Steam will be in October 2021.
